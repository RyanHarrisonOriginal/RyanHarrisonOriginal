# Hey, I’m Ryan 👋

I build things at the intersection of **data, engineering, and ideas**.
This space is where I publish my experiments—apps, data pipelines, and random concepts that I think are worth sharing.

### What you’ll find here 🚀

* Full-stack web apps built with React, Express, and Postgres
* Data pipelines that wrangle, transform, and automate
* AI-powered side projects and experiments with orchestration tools
* Notes, guides, and prototypes that might grow into bigger products

### A little about me 💡

* Director of Data & Analytics by day
* Builder, tinkerer, and system designer by night
* Obsessed with making **data systems elegant, scalable, and useful**
* Always chasing the “aha” moment where code, design, and data click together

### Why this repo collection exists 🌌

I believe the best ideas shouldn’t stay in notebooks or whiteboards.
So I’m shipping them here—raw, polished, or somewhere in between.
If one sparks something for you, let’s connect.
